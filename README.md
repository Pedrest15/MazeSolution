# Maze Solution

<div align="justify" >

This program is a playful way to exemplify the algorithms of <b>Breadth-First Search</b>, <b>Depth-First Search</b>, and <b>A*</b>. A pre-defined maze is created in the `maze.py` file, importing data structures from the `MyDataStructures.py` file. The <b>Stack</b>, <b>Queue</b>, and <b>PriorityQueue</b> are invoked. Finally, the solution algorithms present in `genereic_search.py` are used, solving the maze with each algorithm in turn and printing the solved maze.

Requirements: python==3.x
