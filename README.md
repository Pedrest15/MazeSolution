# Maze Solution

This program is a playful way to exemplify the algorithms of Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, and A*. A pre-defined maze is created in the maze.py file, importing data structures from the MyDataStructures.py file. The Stack, Queue, and PriorityQueue are invoked. Finally, the solution algorithms present in genereic_search.py are used, solving the maze with each algorithm in turn and printing the solved maze.

Requirements: python==3.x
